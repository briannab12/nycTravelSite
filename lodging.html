                        When picking where to stay the night in NYC, cost, safety, and location are all important considerations. Cost varies widely, from $50 for an Airbnb room or motel to thousands of dollars for a luxury suite. Cost usually drops significantly in less neighbors and locations far from Manhattan. When looking for a room for the cheapest price, Airbnb is usually the safer option. Motels selling for $50 a night are most likely not clean or in a dangerous neighborhood. Now let’s consider location. Staying in a cheap location that is far from your destination may not fit into your schedule or be cost effective. It can take more than an hour and half using public transportation to travel across NYC. Also, a taxi may not be faster depending on the traffic and will cost a lot more money. Airbnb is also a great way to stay in a location like Time Square on a low budget. Let’s look at some of the top-rated places to stay the night in NYC that are in safe locations and near some of the top tourist attractions.
