                        New York City (NYC) has so many places to eat that you could eat at a new restaurant every day for 21 years and not run out of new places to try. More importantly, unlike most college towns, NYC has restaurants from a magnitude of cultures that offer dishes authentic to that culture that have not been Americanized. You can find Mexican, Spanish, Japanese, Greek, Mediterranean, French, Philippine, Pakistani, Chinese, Ethiopian, Jamaican, Taiwanese, and many other cuisines. This makes NYC any foodies dream location to visit. NYC also offers a plethora of dining experiences for any budget that do not sacrifice taste. Do not be afraid to stop at a food truck or a restaurant the size of a walk-in closet, because in NYC you cannot judge the quality of food by the location it is served. So, whether you are looking for a cheap eat or a royalty-grade dining experience, you can find a restaurant with five-star food. Here are a few restaurants that come highly recommended.
